On the positive side, nuts like almonds, walnuts, and cashews are rich in healthy fats, protein, and fiber, making them great for heart health and weight management. They also provide essential vitamins and minerals, such as magnesium and vitamin E. However, nuts are calorie-dense, so portion control is important to avoid overeating.

On the other hand, roasted nuts are often more flavorful and crunchy, but they may contain added oils, salts, or sugars. Roasting can also reduce some of the nutrient content, although it enhances the taste. Ultimately, the choice between raw and roasted nuts depends on your dietary preferences and health goals. Opt for unsalted and dry-roasted nuts if you prefer a healthier roasted option.",
